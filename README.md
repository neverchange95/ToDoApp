# ToDoApp
A simple ToDoList app for android smartphones. The application was written with android studio in the programming language Java.
All ToDo elements are saved in a sql-database. The connection to this database is realized with java database connectivity (jdbc).
The sourcecode of this application you can find in this repository under ***Sourcecode/app/src/main/java/com/application*** and the design xml files under ***Sourcecode/app/src/main/res/layout***

### Important!
If you like to use this application on your own smartphone you have to do some things before:
1. Import the folder "Sourcecode" into a new android studio project
2. Download the MySQL-JDBC driver from here: https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/c-j/
3. In android studio go to File -> Project Structure -> Dependencies -> Click on the "+" symbol -> Choose Jar Dependency and import the mysql-connector-java-5.1.49.jar file
4. You need a mysql or mariaDB database running in your own home network or a database which is public
5. Open the file ***Sourcecode/app/src/main/java/com/application/MySQLConnection.java***
Here you will find this line code:
```java
connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://IP-Adress:3306/Database-Name","Database-User","Database-User-Password");
```
  * Change the placeholder ***"IP-Adress"*** to your IP-Adress or Domain where your database is running on
  * Maybe if you use a another port than 3306 change the port ***"3306"*** to the port where your database is listen 
  * Create a new database with the following columns:
  * ***1. Column: Name = ID, Type = int(11), PRIMARY_KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT***
  * ***2. Column: Name = AUFGABE, Type = varchar(50)***
  * ***3. Column: Name = DATUM, Type = varchar(50)***
  * Go back to the MySQLConnection.java file
  * Change the placeholder ***"Database-Name"*** to the name you gave your database
  * Change the placeholder ***"Database-User"*** to the user name which has INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT access to your database
  * Change the placeholder ***"Database-User-Password"*** to the password which you gave the user
6. Save the file and start the android emulator or transfer the application to your smartphone
7. Run the app and have fun with the Todo-List :)
